- 👋 Hi, I’m @subjectiverealityy, or sj, for short. I'm a girl. I'm 20. I live in West Africa. I make pretty websites. I code with HTML and CSS.
- 👀 I’m interested in making simple websites for people. People don't read through complex websites, and especially not when they have animations slowing them down.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making website or apps with UI designers as part of a partnership.
