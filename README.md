- 👋 Hi, I’m Oge. I go by SJcodes online sometimes. This comes from the word 'SubJective' in @subjectiverealityy (my other alias). I'm a girl. I'm 20. I live in West Africa. I make pretty websites. I code with HTML and CSS.
- 👀 I’m interested in making simple websites that people read. People don't read through complex websites, and especially not when they have animations slowing them down. I'm also interested in making useful apps and displaying useful information using xode
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making website or apps with UI designers as part of a partnership.
