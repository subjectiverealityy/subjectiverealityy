- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Oge. I code mainly with HTML and CSS. They're my favourite languages and I'm pretty confident in using them and get more confident with every new project that I build from scratch.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making websites and apps with good performance and UX. I'm also interested in making apps that display and facilitate the exchange of useful information.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, Alpine.JS and UI Design.
- âœ¨ Iâ€™m looking to work with people that want their Figma files converted into readable, well-written code. I'm also looking to work with seasoned developers that want to delegate the frontend part of their builds to a dev that uses semantic HTML and likes to keep projects lightweight by avoiding frameworks and extra lines of code where necessary i.e. me. Both would be a good way to grow as a developer.
