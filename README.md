- 👋 Hi, I’m Oge. I code web interfaces from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- 🌱 I’m interested in making websites and apps with good UX and performance that display and/or facilitate the exchange of useful information.
- ✨ I'm looking to work with developers, UI designers and people that want their Figma files or other forms of UI representation converted into readable, well-written code. 
- 👀 How to reach me - orianaonuora@yahoo.com or subjectiverealityy@gmail.com
- 💫 “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” - Viktor E. Frankl
- ⚡ Fun fact: I go by _SJcodes_ online sometimes. The name comes from the word _'S'ub+'J'ective_ in _@subjectiverealityy_ (my other internet alias).
